# NSOJNMF

A network-based matrix factorization framework for ceRNA co-modules recognition of cancer genomic data


This project builds an multiple genomic integrate framework named network-regularized sparse orthogonal-regularized joint non-negative matrix factorization (NSOJNMF), which integrate mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA expression data and the interaction information of any two of mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA to recognize ceRNA co-modules.
